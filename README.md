## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)
* A Google AI API Key
* Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/PetCare.git](https://github.com/yourusername/PetCare.git)
    cd PetCare
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    * Add your configuration details to this file. It must include your MongoDB connection string, a secret key, email credentials, and your Google AI API key.
        ```env
        SECRET_KEY='a_very_long_and_random_secret_key'
        MONGO_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'
        
        # Get this from Google AI Studio. It is required for the AI Pet Advisor.
        GEMINI_API_KEY='your_google_ai_api_key'
        
        # Example for local MongoDB:
        # MONGO_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/petcare_db'
        
        # Email Configuration (for verification emails)
        MAIL_SERVER='smtp.gmail.com'
        MAIL_PORT=587
        MAIL_USE_TLS=True
        MAIL_USERNAME='your_email@gmail.com'
        MAIL_PASSWORD='your_app_password' 
        ```

### Running the Application

Once everything is installed and configured, you can start the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Creating an Admin User

To create the first administrator account, run the `create_admin.py` script from your **terminal** (not the IDE's run console):

```bash
python create_admin.py
```

Follow the prompts to set up the username, email, and password for the admin account.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

You can also run the application in a Docker container for a standardized deployment.

1.  **Build the Docker Image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t petcare-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container**
    * Make sure to provide your `MONGO_URI` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` as environment variables.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always \
      -e MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string" \
      -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key" \
      --name petcare-container \
      petcare-app
    ```
